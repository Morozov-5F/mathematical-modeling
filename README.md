# Mathematical modelling
This repo contains tasks for mathematical modelling course. Each lab is located
in its own folder, each folder contains its own README.md for task description
and few words about usage.

## Build systems and required tools

All tasks share same build system - GNU Make, which has targets for building,
running and plotting results. All plotting routines handled by GNUPLOT.

Also, some tasks use GSL (GNU Scientific Library).
